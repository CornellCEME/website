		<p>Auditions will be held for those interested in joining CEME. We welcome most levels of musicianship, although we do prefer prospective members to have basic proficiency in their instrument of choice. Please fill out the Google form below, and we will get back to you shortly. Members of CEME are expected to commit to a 2-3 hour rehersal every Sunday, with additional dress rehearsals as needed to prepare for performances. For more information, please email us.</p>
